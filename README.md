# CS340_Project_University_Database

Tuition costs have risen dramatically over the past two decades. Tuition and fees at private universities have increased approximately 112%. Out-of-state tuition and fees at public universities has risen around 98%. In-state tuition and fees show a 107% increase (Wood, 2024). Students are now looking for cost effective educational options while getting the most return on their investment. Our goal was to create a database that can assist in the decision making process. This database is not a finished tool, but a backend implementation for a relational database system that profiles different universities based. The entities reflect realistic costs and factors for higher education decisions: tuition costs, boarding/meals, majors/programs offered, location, acceptance rate, and athletic classification(s). With this database, users can make queries according to their individual priorities. For example, users can find institutions with lower costs, sorted within and compared across athletic classifications (Division I, II, III, and NAIA).The parameters relied on by the database are publicly available and can be updated as needed. Finally, we will be focusing exclusively on four-year institutions.
